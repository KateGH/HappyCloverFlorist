<p>We are an independent local florist with 30 years experience in the business. We pride ourselves on delivering a personal service and we source our flowers as locally as possible to ensure that they are as fresh as possible when they reach you.</p>
<p> 
All gifts can be delivered directly to the recipient and will be gift boxed and accompanied by a gift card. We can also send balloons, a teddy or a box of chocolates as an additional gift with the flowers, depending on the occasion. As we said, we like to create the experience of receiving some of our flowers as personal and as special as possible.</p>
<p>
You can place orders via the website or to discuss a more personal gift option please donâ€™t hesitate to give us a call or pop into our little shop in town and choose it all yourself.
